## Section 1: Project Description

<p>This software allows a user to access and manipulate a stock list. This is helpful as it allows specific products to be stored as objects <br>
which can be accessed and edited to keep track of stock, total stock value, and to search for specific products<p>

## Section 2: Installation Section

<p>This programme is made up of a single python file inventory.py and a text file inventory.txt.<br>
Simply download both files to the same folder to install the programme<p>

## Section 3: Usage Section

<p>The file inventory.txt contains a number of lines of text. The first line simply explains which each word represents in the subsequent strings:<br>
(country,code,product,cost,quantity). This first line is not accessed by inventory.py so make sure a product is not stored here otherwise it will be missed.<br>
The following lines are made up of five words separated by a comma. Inventory.py can only read the lines being in this format, and writes to the file in this format.<p>
<p>Inventory.py when run will give the user a menu of options:<br>
        1) add a shoe to list of shoes<br>
        2) display a list of shoes<br>
        3) restock the shoe with the lowest stock number<br>
        4) search for a shoe<br>
        5) display the shoe with the highest quantity<br>
        6) display a list of shoes with the total value of the stock<br> 
        7) exit<br><p>
<p>The user can access these options by typing in the number next to the menu option<p>
